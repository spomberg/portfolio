## Author

Full-Stack Developer with a knack for finding innovative solutions for solving complex problems in a timely manner.

Throughout my career, I have honed my people skills in other industries where I successfully led projects in different areas. I also trained hundreds of people, as passing down knowledge (while continuously learning) is a passion of mine.

Aside from my passion for coding, my abilities also extend to communication and collaboration with proficiency in interpersonal skills. My strongest suit is that I can bring these two skill sets together in a unique way.

My goal is to now use my skills to make meaningful connections, exchange knowledge and help others while working as a Web Developer.
