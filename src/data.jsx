export const aboutMe = {
  text: `Throughout my career, I have honed my people skills in other industries where I successfully led projects in different areas and headed a 10 people team for 5 years. I also trained hundreds of people, as passing down knowledge (while continuously learning) is a passion of mine. 
  \nAside from my passion for coding, my abilities also extend to communication and collaboration with proficiency in interpersonal skills. My strongest suit is that I can bring these two skill sets together in a unique way. 
  \nMy goal is to now use my skills to make meaningful connections, exchange knowledge and help others while working as a Web Developer.`,
